# This script implements three Python classes for three different artificial
# neural network architectures: no hidden layer, one hidden layer, and two
# hidden layers. Note that this script requires the installation of the
# PyTorch (torch) Python package.

# The TA helped me by explaining what the code is suppose to do.
# Denyslon Fuentes helped me understand it by allowing me to talk it out with him.

# ALSO, PROVIDE ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING TWO QUESTIONS.
#
# Which network architecture achieves the lowest training set error?
# After running the architecture 25 times, AnnTwoHid had the lowest training set error with 0.024067108

# Which network architecture tends to exhibit the best testing set accuracy?
# After running the architecture 25 times, AnnOneHid tends to exhibt the best testing set accuracy with an average testing set accuracy of 0.969892473
