#The TA helped me out a lot for this bfs code
# She told me that the Frontier.pop() command gives you the node its popping so I didn't have that before and I had to set it to a variable
# Also she told me that the Node.expand() command returns a list of node children so I had to set a variable to it for the for loop in the next line.
# She also recommended me to move the second if problem.is_goal(node.loc) inside the for loop since she has experienced it has worked better inside
# From there we worked together to get the work to a good place before running it and making any more adjustments.
